# Iris Classification using Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Welcome to the **Iris Classification using SVM** tutorial! This project demonstrates how to apply **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** to classify the species of iris flowers based on their features. The dataset used in this project is the **Iris Dataset** from `sklearn.datasets`, which contains information about sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

## Project Overview

In this tutorial, we walk through the process of building an **SVM classifier** to classify iris species using the **Iris dataset**. The dataset includes 150 samples of iris flowers, categorized into three species: **Setosa**, **Versicolor**, and **Virginica**. The objective is to train an SVM model, evaluate its performance, and visualize the results.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the **Iris Dataset** from `sklearn.datasets`.

- **Features**: 4 medical variables: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
- **Target**: 3 classes (species of iris flowers): Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica.

## Installation Instructions

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/iris-svm-classification.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd iris-svm-classification
   ```

3. Install the required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   This installs libraries such as:
   - pandas
   - numpy
   - sklearn
   - matplotlib

## Usage

After setting up the environment, execute the following command to train the SVM model, evaluate it, and generate visualizations:

```bash
python iris_svm.py
```

This will output the model's performance, including the **accuracy**, and display the **confusion matrix** and **pairwise feature plots**.

## Project Structure

The project directory contains the following files:

- **iris_svm.py**: Python script for loading the dataset, training the SVM model, evaluating performance, and generating visualizations.
- **requirements.txt**: A file listing all the dependencies required to run the project.
- **confusion_matrix.png**: Visual representation of misclassifications across the species.
- **pairwise_features.png**: Pairwise feature plots to visualize class separability.

## Model Evaluation

The modelâ€™s performance is evaluated using the following metrics:

1. **Accuracy**: Measures how often the model correctly classifies samples.
2. **Confusion Matrix**: Helps assess how well the model classifies each species.
3. **Classification Report**: Provides detailed metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.

## Visualizations

1. **Confusion Matrix**:
   - This plot visualizes the misclassifications across the three classes, showing how well the model distinguishes between the species.

2. **Pairwise Feature Plots**:
   - These plots display pairwise feature combinations to help visualize the class separability in feature space.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the power of **Support Vector Machines** for classification tasks. The model performs well on the **Iris dataset**, achieving a high accuracy and strong classification metrics. Potential improvements could include:
- Fine-tuning SVM hyperparameters (e.g., kernel choice, regularization parameter).
- Experimenting with feature selection or engineering techniques to enhance performance.
